        <li>¾ cup cake flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>3 eggs, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>⅔ cup whole milk, room temperature</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line muffin tins with 20 cupcake liners (for mini cupcakes, line 72 mini muffin tins).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Grind strawberries into a fine powder using a coffee grinder or food processor. Whisk strawberry powder, all-purpose flour, cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Beat butter and sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in vanilla extract.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Stir flour mixture, alternately with the milk, into butter mixture until just incorporated. Fill lined tins with cupcake batter.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bake in preheated oven until cupcakes spring back when gently touched with a fingertip or a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 16 to 18 minutes for regular cupcakes, 8 to 10 minutes for mini cupcakes.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
